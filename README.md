## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Custom Hooks**:  
  Utilized a custom React Hook (`useUser`) to manage and store user session data locally within the application. This ensures state persists across components in a clean and scalable way.

- ✅ **Component Library - shadcn/ui**:  
  The UI components such as buttons, inputs, and combo boxes are implemented using the `shadcn/ui` library, enabling rapid and accessible UI development with full Tailwind CSS customization.

- ✅ **Role-Based Login System**:  
  Simple login logic differentiating between users and admins. Depending on the role, different UI logic is rendered using React state.

- ✅ **Responsive & Accessible UI**:  
  Layouts are mobile-friendly and designed with accessibility in mind using semantic HTML and focusable UI components.

- ✅ **Deployed with Vercel**:  
  The app is hosted on Vercel for fast global access and seamless deployment experience.
